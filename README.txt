Hello team,

This folder contains 4 java files. We can use bikerTest.java which has 11 tests can check various conditions and cases in implementation including some exception cases. I have used normal jdk and have not used any external 3rd party libraries. 

I can be reached at kshitij.2054@gmail.com if any issues are encountered in the implementation or further clarification is required. 

Regards,

Kshitij
